# Wall Wetting Adaptive Learning - Phase 1 & 2 Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the Phase 1 and 2 improvements implemented for the RusEFI wall wetting adaptive learning system. These improvements focus on robustness, reliability, and configurability of the learning algorithm.

## Phase 1 Improvements

### 1. Robust Sensor Validation

**Problem**: Previous implementation had basic validation that could allow poor quality data to influence learning.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive data quality validation system:

- **Lambda Range Validation**: Ensures lambda readings are within physically reasonable bounds (0.5-1.5)
- **Stability Validation**: Checks that lambda deviation from target is within configurable threshold
- **Temperature Validation**: Validates CLT is within learning-appropriate range
- **Load Validation**: Ensures MAP is above minimum threshold for reliable learning
- **Quality Score**: Composite score (0.0-1.0) based on all validation criteria

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `wwMinLambdaStability`: Maximum allowed lambda deviation (default: 15%)
- `wwMinClt`: Minimum CLT for learning (default: 70°C)
- `wwMaxCltForLearning`: Maximum CLT for learning (default: 110°C)
- `wwMinMapForLearning`: Minimum MAP for learning (default: 30 kPa)
- `wwEnableRobustValidation`: Enable/disable robust validation

### 2. Confidence Tracking System

**Problem**: No way to track learning quality or convergence of individual cells.

**Solution**: Implemented per-cell confidence tracking:

- **Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 score based on data quality and consistency
- **Sample Count**: Number of learning events per cell
- **Variance Tracking**: Monitors consistency of adjustments
- **Convergence Detection**: Automatically detects when cells have stabilized

**Benefits**:
- Adaptive learning rates based on cell confidence
- Visual feedback on learning progress
- Automatic detection of well-calibrated regions

### 3. Thread Safety

**Problem**: Static buffers could cause race conditions in multi-threaded environments.

**Solution**: Moved all buffers to instance members:

- Lambda, RPM, and MAP buffers are now per-controller instance
- Eliminates potential race conditions
- Allows multiple controller instances if needed

### 4. Optimal Buffer Sizing

**Problem**: Fixed buffer sizes didn't account for different engine operating conditions.

**Solution**: Dynamic buffer sizing based on physics:

- Buffer size calculated from tau (time constant) and RPM
- Ensures adequate sampling for different transient characteristics
- Respects configured minimum and maximum limits
- Accounts for sample multiplier for fine-tuning

**Formula**: `bufferSize = (tau * 2.0 * rpm / 60.0) * multiplier`

## Phase 2 Improvements

### 1. Drift Reset Mechanism

**Problem**: Long-term drift could accumulate without any reset mechanism.

**Solution**: Automatic drift detection and reset:

- **Variance Monitoring**: Tracks variance in each cell over time
- **Consecutive Adjustment Tracking**: Monitors cells that continuously adjust
- **Automatic Reset**: Resets problematic cells to default values
- **Configurable Intervals**: User-configurable reset intervals

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `wwEnableDriftReset`: Enable/disable automatic drift reset
- `wwDriftResetIntervalMin`: Interval between drift checks (default: 30 min)
- `wwMaxVarianceThreshold`: Maximum allowed variance before reset (default: 10%)
- `wwMaxConsecutiveAdjustments`: Max consecutive adjustments before reset (default: 10)

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery

**Problem**: System could get stuck in poor calibration states.

**Solution**: Multiple recovery mechanisms:

- **Quality-based rejection**: Poor quality data is rejected before processing
- **Confidence-based learning rates**: Lower confidence cells learn more slowly
- **Automatic cell reset**: Problematic cells are automatically reset
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operating even with sensor issues

### 3. Configurable Parameters

**Problem**: Many parameters were hardcoded, limiting tuning flexibility.

**Solution**: Made all critical parameters configurable:

- All thresholds and limits are now user-configurable
- Default values provide good starting point
- Parameters are validated with reasonable bounds
- TunerStudio interface for easy adjustment

## Configuration Guide

### Basic Setup

1. **Enable Robust Validation**:
   ```
   wwEnableRobustValidation = true
   ```

2. **Set Learning Conditions**:
   ```
   wwMinClt = 70                    // Minimum coolant temperature
   wwMaxCltForLearning = 110        // Maximum coolant temperature
   wwMinMapForLearning = 30         // Minimum MAP (kPa)
   wwMinLambdaStability = 15        // Maximum lambda deviation (%)
   ```

3. **Configure Drift Reset**:
   ```
   wwEnableDriftReset = true
   wwDriftResetIntervalMin = 30     // Check every 30 minutes
   wwMaxVarianceThreshold = 10      // Reset if variance > 10%
   wwMaxConsecutiveAdjustments = 10 // Reset after 10 consecutive adjustments
   ```

### Advanced Tuning

1. **Buffer Sizing**:
   ```
   wwMinSampleSize = 100            // Minimum samples per learning event
   wwMaxSampleSize = 400            // Maximum samples per learning event
   wwSampleMultiplier = 1.5         // Multiplier for calculated optimal size
   ```

2. **Confidence System**:
   ```
   wwMinSamplesForConfidence = 5    // Minimum samples to build confidence
   wwConfidenceDecayRate = 95       // Confidence decay rate (%)
   ```

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Version

1. **Configuration Migration**: 
   - Previous configurations remain compatible
   - New parameters use sensible defaults
   - Gradual migration recommended

   1. Update firmware
   2. Enable robust validation
   3. Monitor learning for 1-2 weeks
   4. Enable drift reset after confidence builds
   5. Fine-tune parameters based on results
